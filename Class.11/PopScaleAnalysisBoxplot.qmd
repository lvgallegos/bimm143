## Population Scale Analysis

How many samples do we have? 
```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

BOXPLOT 

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
```

> Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes. 

> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

From the relative expression value between A|A and G|G, we can infer that they are statistically significant and very different since the boxplot shows no (major) overlap between the notches. Thus, the SNP affects expression of ORMDL3.
